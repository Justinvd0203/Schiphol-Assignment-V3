# Schiphol-Assignment-V3

This README document will function as a way to track my train of thought and provide additional information.

## Task #1
Task 1 can be divided into multiple parts:
-   Setup Spark environment
-   Load dataset
-   Create Spark job

### Setup Spark environment
The first task is to set up spark with a reproducible outcome therefore there was looking into the use of docker.
For this I used the image of https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/spark and produced a docker-compose.yml file

This setup of spark containers 1 master node and 2 workes, this can be scaled up and down if necessary.
To test this setup the user can navigate to http://localhost:8080/
